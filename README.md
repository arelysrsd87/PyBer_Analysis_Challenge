# PyBer_Analysis_Challenge
# Overview of the analysis
- Using Python and Pandas, we created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. 
- Using Pandas and Matplotlib, we created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 
- Summarized how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
## Purpose
- The analysis and visualization produce will help PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
# Results
## Differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types
Below can be find a summary on the ride-sharing data for the different city types:
![PyBer_Summary]()
- Rural cities had the lowest number of rides and drivers (125 and 78, respectively). Additionally, rural cities brought in the least amount of momey in total fares ($4, 327.93), while having the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver ($34. 62 and $55.49, respectively).
- Suburban cities had below average numbers for rides and drivers (625 and 490, respectively). Additionally, suburban cities brought in $19, 356.33 on total fares, while having a relatively high average fare per ride and average fare per driver ($30.97 and $39.50, respectively).
- Urban cities had the largest number of rides and drivers (1, 625 and 2, 405, respectively). Additionally, urban cities brought in the largest amount of money in total fares ($39, 854.38), while still having the lowest average fare per ride and lowest average fare per driver, ($24.53 and $16.57, respecetively). 
- The Total Fare by City Type multi-line chart visually ilustrates the above points where urban cities brought in the largest amount of total fare for Spring 2019 and rural cities brought in the least amount of money in total fares.

# Summary
Based on the results, we recommend the below for addressing any disparities among the city types:
- Increase exposure of PyBer ride-sharing services on rural cities in an effort to increase the number of rides per time.
- Having achieved and larger number of rides per time, can allow drivers to lower their average fare per ride. Lower fares per ride will attract more customers to utilize PyBer's ride-sharing services.
- As the demand of rides rises in rural cities, we recommend hiring more drivers. A healthy competintion between drivers can lower fares per ride, hence attracting more customer to utilize PyBer's ride-sharing services.
